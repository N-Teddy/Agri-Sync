# Technology Stack for AgriSync Pro

## Core Architecture Decision: React.js PWA

### Why PWA First?
- **Faster Development**: Single codebase for all devices
- **Offline Capability**: Service workers for field use
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on phones, tablets, desktops
- **No App Store Deployment**: Immediate updates
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Can add native features later

## 🚀 Frontend Technologies (React.js PWA)

### Core Framework
```javascript
// React with TypeScript
- React 18+ with Functional Components & Hooks
- TypeScript for type safety
- Vite as build tool (faster than Create React App)
```


### UI & Styling
```javascript
// Component Libraries
- Material-UI (MUI) v5 - Professional design system
- Emotion for custom styling
- React Router v6 for navigation

// Why MUI?
- Pre-built accessible components

INSERT INTO fields (name, boundary)
VALUES ('Field A', ST_GeomFromGeoJSON('{"type":"Polygon",...}'));

-- Calculate area in hectares
SELECT name, ST_Area(boundary) / 10000 as area_hectares
FROM fields;

-- Find fields within distance
SELECT * FROM fields
WHERE ST_DWithin(boundary, ST_Point(lon, lat), distance);
```

### 4. **Real-time Data Flow**

- **Supabase** - PostgreSQL with real-time

## 🚨 Potential Challenges & Solutions

### PWA Limitations:
```markdown
**Challenge**: Limited background processing
**Solution**: Use periodic sync and push notifications

**Challenge**: iOS PWA restrictions
**Solution**: Focus on core features, consider Cordova later

**Challenge**: Storage limits
**Solution**: Implement data pruning and cloud sync
```

### Geospatial Performance:
```markdown
**Challenge**: Large field boundary data
**Solution**: Simplify polygons, use spatial indexes

**Challenge**: Real-time weather updates
**Solution**: WebSocket connections, efficient diffing
```

## 📱 PWA-Specific Features to Implement

### App Manifest
```json
{
  "name": "AgriSync Pro",
  "short_name": "AgriSync",
  "description": "Farm Management & Weather Intelligence",
  "theme_color": "#2E7D32",
  "background_color": "#FFFFFF",
  "display": "standalone",
  "scope": "/",
  "start_url": "/",
  "icons": [...],
  "screenshots": [...]
}
```

### Service Worker Strategy
```javascript
// Cache strategies:
- App shell: CacheFirst
- Weather data: NetworkFirst (1 hour)
- Field data: NetworkFirst with background sync
- Static assets: CacheFirst
```

This technology stack gives you a solid foundation for building AgriSync Pro as a PWA while maintaining the ability to expand into native mobile apps later if needed.

**Next Steps**: Begin with React PWA setup and basic mapping functionality, then progressively add backend services and advanced features.
