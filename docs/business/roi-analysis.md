### Detailed Cost Savings Analysis

#### 1. Chemical Applications Savings

**Baseline (Without AgriSync Pro):**

- Average: 5 spray applications per season
- 2 seasons per year (many crops)
- Cost per application: 120,000 XAF/100ha
- Annual cost: 5 × 2 × 120,000 = **1,200,000 XAF**
- Yield loss from late intervention: 10-15% = **1,200,000 - 1,800,000 XAF**
- **Total cost:** 2,400,000 - 3,000,000 XAF

**With AgriSync Pro:**

- Preventive alerts reduce to 3 applications/season (40% reduction)
- Better timing reduces yield loss to 2-5%
- Annual cost: 3 × 2 × 120,000 = **720,000 XAF**
- Yield loss: 2-5% = **240,000 - 600,000 XAF**
- **Total cost:** 960,000 - 1,320,000 XAF

**Savings:** **1,440,000 - 1,680,000 XAF** (50-60% reduction)

  - Application before unexpected rain (leaching)
  - Application during drought (poor absorption)
  - Wrong timing relative to crop stage
- Annual fertilizer budget: 4,000,000 XAF

**With AgriSync Pro:**

- Weather-aware application timing
- Crop stage optimization
- Loss reduced to 8-12%
- **Loss:** 8-12% = **320,000 - 480,000 XAF**

---

#### 5. Prevented Catastrophic Losses

**Baseline (Without AgriSync Pro):**

- Average 1-2 significant weather/disease events per year

### Sensitivity Analysis

**Impact of Alert Accuracy on ROI:**

| Alert Accuracy | Prevented Losses | Net Benefit Change | ROI Impact |
| -------------- | ---------------- | ------------------ | ---------- |
| 50%            | 600,000 XAF      | -600,000 XAF       | -12%       |
| 70%            | 1,400,000 XAF    | +200,000 XAF       | +4%        |
| 90%            | 1,980,000 XAF    | +780,000 XAF       | +16%       |

**Conclusion:** System remains profitable even at 50% alert accuracy. Current pilot accuracy: 78-85%.
