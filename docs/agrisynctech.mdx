Excellent approach. Proper planning before database design is crucial. Let's create comprehensive diagrams and detailed functionality planning.

## 1. System Overview & Core Planning

### System Vision
**AgriSync Pro**: A decision-support system that transforms weather data and farm records into actionable intelligence for plantation managers.

### Core Value Propositions
1. **Prevent Loss**: Early warning system for weather risks and disease outbreaks
2. **Optimize Resources**: Precision timing for irrigation, spraying, and harvesting
3. **Centralize Knowledge**: Digital record-keeping with intelligent insights
4. **Scale Expertise**: Make experienced manager knowledge systematic and reproducible

## 2. Actor Identification & Use Case Diagrams

This detailed planning gives us a clear roadmap before we even think about database design. Each use case will directly inform our entity relationships and data models.

Would you like me to:
1. Create more detailed sequence diagrams for specific workflows?
2. Define the complete API specification based on these use cases?
3. Proceed to database design and ERD creation based on this planning?
