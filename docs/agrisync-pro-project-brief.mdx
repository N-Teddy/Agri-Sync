# AgriSync Pro Project Brief

## Project Snapshot
- **Vision**: Deliver a digital farm manager that fuses hyper-local weather, crop activity tracking, and financial insights so plantation teams can act before risks hit yield.
- **Target users**: Cameroonian plantation owners, farm managers, and field supervisors overseeing 50–500+ hectares.
- **Core value**: Prevent crop loss, optimize resource use, and centralize institutional knowledge through proactive, data-backed recommendations.
- **Engagement model**: B2B2C SaaS with annual subscriptions priced by monitored hectares and a no-risk 50-hectare pilot.

## Pain Points We Solve
- **Weather uncertainty**: Regional forecasts miss micro-climate swings that ruin planting, spraying, and irrigation schedules.
- **Reactive operations**: Pests, diseases, and water stress are discovered only after visible damage, burning labor and inputs.
- **Resource inefficiency**: Diesel, fertilizer, and labor are wasted because timing is based on habit instead of conditions.
- **Information silos**: Weather data, crop logs, and financial records live in disconnected notebooks or personal memory.

## Solution Overview
AgriSync Pro combines three pillars to act as a digital command center:
1. **Hyper-local weather intelligence** – merges field boundaries, elevation data, and multiple APIs to generate field-level forecasts with actionable alerts (e.g., "Coffee Field C-4: 15 mm rain 2–4 PM tomorrow").
2. **Integrated crop and activity management** – digital logbook with growth stage tracking, activity histories, and photo evidence to understand cause and effect across a season.
3. **AI-powered alerting and recommendations** – evaluates weather, crop stage, and historical behavior to trigger preventive advisories (frost, disease, irrigation, harvest windows) through push/SMS.

### Contextual Case Studies
- **Banana Black Sigatoka**: Humidity >90 % and ~25 °C triggers a high-risk alert, enabling fungicide application within 24 hours, cutting chemical spend by up to 40 % and preserving 25–45 % yield.
- **Rice irrigation (Ndop Plain)**: Evapotranspiration and soil trends flag optimal watering windows, reducing diesel 15–20 % and improving fertilizer efficiency 15–20 %.
- **Coffee frost protection**: Field-level temperature dips prompt alerts hours ahead, saving 60–70 % of potential harvest losses.

## Personas & Critical Workflows
| Role | Responsibilities | High-Value Journeys |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Plantation Owner** | Approves investment, monitors profitability | Registration & onboarding, team setup, financial dashboard, scheduled report exports |
| **Farm Manager** | Plans operations, configures alerts, assigns work | Morning briefing, season planning, alert configuration & response, disease/pest monitoring, financial & labor oversight |
| **Field Supervisor** | Executes and logs field tasks, scouts risks | Daily task review via mobile PWA, offline activity logging with photos, disease/pest scouting, alert response verification |

Primary flows are captured in `docs/userflow.md` and `docs/AgriSync Pro User Flow Diagram.svg`, detailing navigation from authentication through offline sync.

## Product Scope

### Field & Crop Management
- Draw geo-referenced fields, auto-calc area, store soil/elevation notes.
- Configure crop calendars with planting/harvest, growth-stage tracking, and activity history.
- View per-field dashboards (weather, alerts, photos, activities).

### Activity Logging
- Log land prep, planting, fertilizer, spraying, weeding, irrigation, and harvest events with optional inputs and photos.
- Offline-first mobile workflow with conflict resolution once connected.

### Weather Intelligence
- Current conditions and 3–7-day forecasts per field with confidence indicators.
- Weather impact analysis (rainfall vs. soil moisture, temperature vs. growth).
- Map overlays for weather fronts and risk hotspots.

### Alert & Notification Engine
- Pre-built rules for frost, heavy rain, heat stress, disease, irrigation, and harvest timing.
- Configurable thresholds, recipients, and delivery channels (push, SMS, in-app).
- Alert lifecycle: generation → notification → acknowledgement → logged response.

### Financial Tracking & Reporting
- Input cost recording (product, amount, field allocation) and harvest sale tracking.
- Profitability snapshots per field/season with gross margin indicators.
- Dashboards for weather overview, activity timeline, alerts, and cost vs. revenue.
- Report builder for financials, weather impact, and alert effectiveness (exportable PDF/Excel).

## MVP Scope (First 6 Weeks)
Derived from `docs/mvp.md`, the MVP targets rapid value delivery:
1. **Week 1–2** – Authentication, single-plantation setup, draw up to five fields.
2. **Week 2–3** – Crop planning with predefined crops (Coffee, Cocoa, Plantain/Banana, Maize) plus basic activity logging.
3. **Week 3–4** – Weather display (current + 3-day) and essential alerts (heavy rain, heat/cold extremes, frost).
4. **Week 4–5** – Input cost capture and harvest revenue logging with per-field profit.
5. **Week 5–6** – Unified dashboard and simple reports (field performance, seasonal P&L, weather impact summary).

**Out of scope initially**: multi-user roles beyond owner, advanced alert customization, AI-driven disease models, inventory tracking, offline sync, SMS/email notifications, and multi-plantation support.

## Beyond MVP Enhancements
- Role-based access control with granular permissions.
- Advanced rules engine and configurable notification matrix.
- Offline-first synchronization, worker management, and inventory tracking.
- Predictive analytics (yield forecasting, disease/pest ML models, irrigation optimization).
- API integrations for market prices and third-party sensors.

## AI & Decision Intelligence Roadmap

### High Priority (Launch + first data)
1. **Weather downscaling** – ML models combining topography, historical data, and APIs for field-level forecasts.
2. **Disease risk prediction** – Classification blending humidity, temperature, crop stage, and treatment history (e.g., Black Sigatoka).
3. **Pest infestation forecasting** – Time-series models capturing seasonal pest cycles per crop and micro-climate.
4. **Yield prediction** – Regression using weather, activity logs, and input usage to anticipate season outcomes.

### Medium Priority (Post data maturity)
5. **Irrigation optimization** – Evapotranspiration + soil models recommending exact watering windows.
6. **Harvest timing** – Growing Degree Day tracking to pinpoint market-ready windows.
7. **Input recommendations** – Prescription suggestions for fertilizer/chemicals based on soil and historical performance.

### Advanced (After 6–12 months of data)
8. **Anomaly detection** – Surface unusual field patterns using unsupervised learning.
9. **Climate adaptation insights** – Long-term guidance to adjust practices to shifting climate baselines.

Start with rule-based heuristics, collect 6–12 months of field data, then replace high-value rules with localized AI models.

  - Diesel (irrigation): 15–20 % reduction via precise scheduling.
  - Fertilizer efficiency: 20 % savings through optimized timing.
  - Labor productivity: 15 % efficiency gain from proactive planning.
  - Yield: 10–15 % increase by mitigating weather/disease shocks.
- **Net impact**: 20–35 % lift in net profitability when alerts and insights are actioned consistently.

## Setup & Enablement Notes
