Based on the functionalities, here are the points where **AI intervention** will be needed:

## 🧠 **High-Priority AI Needs**

### 1. **Weather Downscaling**
- **Problem**: Converting regional forecasts to field-level micro-climate predictions
- **AI Solution**: ML models using topography, elevation, historical patterns
- **Data Needed**: Field boundaries, elevation data, historical weather patterns

### 2. **Disease Risk Prediction**
- **Problem**: Predicting disease outbreaks before visible symptoms
- **AI Solution**: Classification models using weather + crop stage + historical outbreaks
- **Data Needed**: Weather conditions, crop growth stages, historical disease data

### 3. **Pest Infestation Forecasting**
- **Problem**: Predicting pest cycles and infestation risks
- **AI Solution**: Time-series forecasting with seasonal patterns
- **Data Needed**: Pest occurrence history, weather data, crop types

### 4. **Yield Prediction**
- **Problem**: Accurate yield estimation for planning and sales
- **AI Solution**: Regression models using weather, inputs, crop health
- **Data Needed**: Historical yields, input applications, weather patterns

## 📊 **Medium-Priority AI Needs**

### 5. **Irrigation Optimization**
- **Problem**: Precise water requirement calculation
- **AI Solution**: Evapotranspiration models + soil moisture prediction
- **Data Needed**: Soil type, weather, crop water requirements

### 6. **Harvest Timing Prediction**
- **Problem**: Optimal harvest window determination
- **AI Solution**: Crop maturity models using growing degree days
- **Data Needed**: Planting dates, temperature data, variety characteristics

### 7. **Input Recommendation**
- **Problem**: Optimized fertilizer and chemical application
- **AI Solution**: Prescription models based on soil health and crop needs
- **Data Needed**: Soil tests, crop requirements, historical application results

## 🔮 **Advanced AI Opportunities**

### 8. **Anomaly Detection**
- **Problem**: Identifying unusual patterns in field data

## 🚨 **Critical Note**
**Start with rule-based systems** for MVP. Add AI incrementally as you collect sufficient field data (6-12 months of operation).

The database schema supports all these AI needs with:
- Time-series weather data
- Historical yield records
- Disease/pest occurrence tracking
- Field-specific environmental data
